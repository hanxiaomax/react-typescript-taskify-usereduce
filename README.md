with usereduce example


Key takeway

1. write a reducer called TodoReducer to handle the dispatch
2. dispatch in the onclick function and send the type and payload (here I use Todo as payload's type instead of number shown in the video)
3. pass the dispatch function instead of setTodo and other function fom App.tsx all the way down to the SingleTodoWithUseReduce and use it

I am new to React, correct me if I am wrong
